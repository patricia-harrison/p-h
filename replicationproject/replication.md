# Assessment 1: Replication project

*Fill out the following workbook with information relevant to your project.*

*Markdown reference:* [https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/](http://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

## Replication project choice ##
"Guitar"

## Related projects ##
*Find about 6 related projects to the project you choose. A project might be related through  function, technology, materials, fabrication, concept, or code. Don't forget to place an image of the related project in the* `replicationproject` *folder and insert the filename in the appropriate places below. Copy the markdown block of code below for each project you are showing, updating the number* `1` *in the subtitle for each.*

## Reading reflections ##
*Reflective reading is an important part of actually making your reading worthwhile. Don't just read the words to understand what they say: read to see how the ideas in the text fit with and potentially change your existing knowledge and maybe even conceptual frameworks. We assume you can basically figure out what the readings mean, but the more important process is to understand how that changes what you think, particularly in the context of your project.*

*For each of the assigned readings, answer the questions below.*

### Reading: Don Norman, The Design of Everyday Things, Chapter 1 (The Psychopathology of Everyday Things) ###

*What I thought before:* Most people don't tend to give much thought to everyday objects and why they're designed the way they are. Before reading this chapter, I only occasionally gave thought to the design of everyday objects, but never truly questioned their design. 

*What I learned:* After reading this chapter my viewpoint of the design of everyday objects has changed. I now question the design of most common objects I come across throughout my days - especially the dreaded door. Through reading this chapter I was also able to add the term 'discoverablity' to my vocabulary and that it is an esential part of all design. It was said that many products fail because they lack discoverability and understanding. 

Describe what you now know or believe as a result of the reading. Don't just describe the reading: write about what changed in YOUR knowledge.*

Thanks to this reading, my understanding of design has improved. If only I had been asked to read this a few years ago, the products I produced in my IT class (in highschool) would have been 1000 times better. The chapter read covers essential bases of design, which include; Human Centered Design and the fundamental principals of interaction. Human Centered Design, or HCD is absolutly essential as it determines whether a design matches the capablites and needs of its target audiance. An example of this could be Google Maps and its voice assistant which gives you directions while driving without having to glance down at the drivers smartphone. The implementation of this voice assistant would have prevented many potential car accidents. The fundamental principals of interaction encompass five psycological concepts; Affordances, Signifiers, Mapping, Feedback, and Conceptual Models. Affordances is all about the relationship of information we are able to glean from around us. Signifiers are the properties that aid us in determining where the action takes place (signifiers include signs, drawings and labels.) Mapping is the relationship between two sets of things. For example, while driving a car, the steering wheel creates a sort of map for direction. Feedback is relatively self explanitory. The lack of feedback will create frustration while using any product. Receiving feedback from an object is very important as it allowed you to truly interact with it. Conceptual models are a highly simplified explanation of how something works. Conceptual models can vary depending on the user, their culture or their religion. 

*What I would like to know more about:* I would definitely like to learn more about human centered design as it is so essential to all products produced in the world. 

*How this relates to the project I am working on:* The concept of this chapter relates to my replication project as there is constant feedback between the object (guitar) and the user. Through this constant feedback, it encourages the user to explore and experiment with the object in order to discover what the object can do. 

### Reading: Chapter 1 of Dan Saffer, Microinteractions: Designing with Details, Chapter 1 ###

*What I thought before:* Before reading chapter one of this book I was not entirely aware of microinteractions all the time. The only times I became truly aware of these microinteractions is usually while playing video games, expecially ones that have incredible detail, whether this be the way you character interacts with the environment around them (e.g. hair/clothing texture changing with the environment around them) or with npcs, etc. 

*What I learned:* Through reading this chapter I was able to gain a better understanding of microinteractions and how important they really are. Microinteractions are the small pieces of functionality that are all around us and make our overall experiences better. 

*What I would like to know more about:* 
Describe or write a question about something that you would be interested in knowing more about.*


*How this relates to the project I am working on: Describe the connection between the ideas in the reading and one of your current projects or how ideas in the reading could be used to improve your project.*

### Reading: Scott Sullivan, Prototyping Interactive Objects ###

*What I thought before: Describe something that you thought or believed before you read the source that was challenged by the reading.*

*What I learned: Describe what you now know or believe as a result of the reading. Don't just describe the reading: write about what changed in YOUR knowledge.*

*What I would like to know more about: Describe or write a question about something that you would be interested in knowing more about.*

*How this relates to the project I am working on: Describe the connection between the ideas in the reading and one of your current projects or how ideas in the reading could be used to improve your project.*


## Interaction flowchart ##
*Draw a flowchart of the interaction process in your project. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Process documentation

*In this section, include text and images that represent the development of your project including sources you've found (URLs and written references), choices you've made, sketches you've done, iterations completed, materials you've investigated, and code samples. Use the markdown reference for help in formatting the material.*

*This should have quite a lot of information!*

*There will likely by a dozen or so images of the project under construction. The images should help explain why you've made the choices you've made as well as what you have done. Use the code below to include images, and copy it for each image, updating the information for each.*

![Image](missingimage.png)

*Include screenshots of the code you have used.*

## Project outcome ##

*Complete the following information.*

### Project title ###

### Project description ###

*In a few sentences, describe what the project is and does, who it is for, and a typical use case.*

### Showcase image ###

*Try to capture the image as if it were in a portfolio, sales material, or project proposal. The project isn't likely to be something that finished, but practice making images that capture the project in that style.*

### Additional view ###

*Provide some other image that gives a viewer a different perspective on the project such as more about how it functions, the project in use, or something else.*

### Reflection ###

*Describe the parts of your project you felt were most successful and the parts that could have done with improvement, whether in terms of outcome, process, or understanding.*


*What techniques, approaches, skills, or information did you find useful from other sources (such as the related projects you identified earlier)?*


*What ideas have you read, heard, or seen that informed your thinking on this project? (Provide references.)*


*What might be an interesting extension of this project? In what other contexts might this project be used?*
