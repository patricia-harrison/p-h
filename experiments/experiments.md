In this experiment, I was able to learn what a phototransistor is and how it functions on a basic level. A phototransistor reacts to differing light levels and shows this through how well it conduct electricity - the more light that is shone on the transistor, the more effectively it transmits electricity. 

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as daylight sensors, smoke detecters, infrared receivers, etc. 

### Dimming an LED using a potentiometer ###

In this experiment, I made contact with a potentiometer. Before this experiment, I wouldn't have known what said object is. After completing the project, I understood that a potentiometer is quite literally a dimmer switch in a sense. 

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as mood lighting.

### Say "Hello" to the BBC nicro:bit! ###

In this experiment, I leanrt about 'stings' on a very basic level. This had been one of the very first experiments I had completed during this course. It was an excellent introduction to making interaction.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as childrens toys, elevators, computers, etc. 

### Setting the tone with a Piezo Buzzer###

In this experiment, I was able to learn hoe to 'code' and play music via the micro:bit and the Piezo buzzer. It was thoroughly enjoyable to attempt to recreate some of my favourite little tunes while learning at the same time. 

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as door bells, toys, etc. 

### Using a transistor to drive a motor ###

In this experiment, I was able to learn that you can use a transistor as a sort of gate for energy to flow through. 

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as ......(insert something here).
